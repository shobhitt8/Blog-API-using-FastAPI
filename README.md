# My FastAPI Blog API Project

## Introduction

This project is a simple FastAPI-based RESTful API for managing a blog. It includes user authentication, blog CRUD operations, and a dashboard feature that fetches blogs based on user-followed tags.

## Technology Stack

- Python
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- MongoDB
- Docker

## Project Objectives

- Demonstrate proficiency in building RESTful APIs with FastAPI.
- Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT.
- Manage CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog data.
- Implement pagination and sorting of blog content.
- Follow best practices for code structure and API architecture.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication:

- Register new users
- Login existing users
- Update user profiles
- Add/remove user tags (keywords or their interests like coding, photography, etc.)

### Blogs:

- Create new blogs
- Retrieve all blogs (with pagination)
- Retrieve a specific blog by ID
- Update existing blogs
- Delete blogs

### Dashboard:

- Fetch all blogs matching user's followed tags (sorted by relevance)
- Implement sorting logic to prioritize blogs with tags the user likes.
- Implement pagination.

## Deployment

The API is Dockerized and can be deployed to a free hosting platform like [render.com](https://render.com).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git


Certainly! A good README file is essential for providing information about your project. Here's a basic template that you can use as a starting point. Customize it based on the specifics of your project:
